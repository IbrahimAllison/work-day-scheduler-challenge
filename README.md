# work-day-scheduler-challenge

**Description**

This project involves the creation of a calendar application, which allows a user to enter and save an hourly work day events using a regular work day schedule between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM. 

**Motivation for the Project**

I am motivated to work on the project because I want to see how a developer uses an API to solve real world scenarios. The Work Day Scheduler is similar to a calendar application that a user can use to plan their working day tasks and activities.

**What Problem Does it solve?** 

The Work Day Scheduler solves the problem of misplaced priorities by employees at work. It helps an employee to plan their schedule and effectively manage their time so as to achieve their professional and project objectives. 

**Usage** 

The project contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript codes. The calendar application will run in the browser. It is editable. 
A user clicks on the text box beside the scheduled time and enters their event(s) for the time block. The user then clicks on the Save button (Locked Padlock icon) to save their entries or texts. The events are saved in the Local Storage and persist.
